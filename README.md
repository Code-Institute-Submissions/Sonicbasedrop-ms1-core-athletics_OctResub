### Design

#### Colour Scheme
The four main colours used are Red, Black, Gray and White. 

#### Typography

The headers on all pages throughout the Website are using the Monserrat font, while the main text is using the Poppins font. Sans-serif is the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn’t being imported into the site correctly. 

#### Imagery
Imagery is important. Therefore, the hero and background images are chosen in order to catch the users’ attention and create a feel good atmosphere and sense of the aspiration towards a healthy, holistic life style that CA offers its clients.
