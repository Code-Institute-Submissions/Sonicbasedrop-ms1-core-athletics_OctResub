### Design

#### Colour Scheme
The four main colours used are Black, Gray, White and Blue, as these are aligned with CA brand colours. 

#### Typography

The headers on all pages throughout the Website are using the Roboto font, while the main text is using the Lato font. Sans-serif is the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn’t being imported into the site correctly. 

#### Imagery
Imagery is important. Therefore, the many hero and background images are chosen in order to catch the users’ attention and create a feel good atmosphere and sense of the aspiration towards a health, holistic life style that CA offers its clients.
