The Home Page will contain appealing visuals and brief information of CA. The purpose of this is to fulfill user story:

*	As a First Time user, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about CA.

Custom CSS and/or Bootstrap will be used to make the Website responsive by the use of media queries and/or the Bootstrap Grid system.

All pages will be responsive and the layouts will change dependent on screen size. This is to ensure content flow is appealing, images are displayed properly and that the content is not shrunk side by side, so small that it is unreadable. The purpose of this is to fulfill user story:

* As a First Time user, I want to view the website and content clearly on my mobile device.

All pages will contain a Footer Element with contact information, a field to sign up for newsletters, and social media. The icons used will be from font-awesome.

*	As a First Time user, I want to know where CA is located
*	As a Returning user, I want to contact CA so I can request more information


The Pricing Page will contain prices of CA’s various services. The purpose of this is to fulfill user stories:
*	As a First Time user, I want to get an overview of the price of CA’s services. 
*	As a Frequent user, I want to check for discounts and VIP offers. 

The Contact Page will contain a form that can be used to contact CA through the website. The purpose of this Page is to fulfill user stories:

*	As a Returning user, I want to contact CA so that I can request more information.
*	As a Frequent user, I want to sign up to the Newsletter so that I am emailed about any major updates and/or changes to the website or CA.

### Design

#### Colour Scheme
The four main colours used are shade of Red #F85E5E, shade of Blue #276dbd, Gray #696666 and White #fff. 

#### Typography

The headers on all pages throughout the Website are using the Monserrat font, while the main text is using the Poppins font. Sans-serif is the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn’t being imported into the site correctly. 

#### Imagery
Imagery is important. Therefore, the hero and background images are chosen in order to catch the users’ attention and create a feel good atmosphere and sense of the aspiration towards a healthy, holistic life style that CA offers its clients.

##  Testing

### Test Strategy
#### Summary

  * As this project is static and contains no back-end functionality, the testing performed will be on the visual effects and layout of the Website. Testing to be done on at least three    web browsers and all screen sizes.

  * No elements should overlap another container div. All elements should remain on the screen at all sizes above 300px. 

  * All nav links should direct to the correct html pages as per their names. The Home page is the exception, this one will redirect to index.html.

  * All links to external websites must open in a new browser.

  * Testing of form validation will also be required to ensure the correct inputs are taken and that all fields are required.

  * Validation of inclusion for all features included in the Structure of the Website / Wireframes must be performed.
